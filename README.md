## Questions
### Display markdown files on Githubpages using Jekyll - \_config.yml
[Ref](https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/). I have to figure out how to apply .yml if I start with a repository without any
configuration file.

### MkDocs - to be used to Github pages formatting 2
[Materials for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

### Cut and resize image at the same time
[multiple solutions here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/493296/css-display-an-image-resized-and-cropped);

### How enable efficient whole-website keyword search?
to simplify review and summary of previous notes/ideas; also enable multi-task viewing, like across-notes

### Timeline structure of contents shown explicitly?
to clearly show my learning/career paths



## Potential projects to put

Thanks to https://yang-xijie.github.io, I got inspired by structures and contents

### My learning and notes
links to my Github repositories

### Languages, hobbies, etc

### Coursera 
[Python and web scrapping](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-science/home/week/1)
 there is a 6-month extension to the IBM cloud trial account, while the IBM cloud account is necessary to create the final result of the final project of week 1; decide carefully when to start the trial + this extension. \
[Prerequisite](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai/lecture/W6xwd/rest-apis-http-requests-part-1)


### Data analysis
mindmaps, summaries

### Insights and ideas into certain topics
the difference between subjects with experiments and surveys in real word, and those only need pen&paper(pure maths except part of stats; theoretic physics?): collect facts from real world and trace back to study the underlying mechanism (e.g. empirical stats in finance like empirical duration), while the latter ones build mechanism and structure of theory to lead to results in real word (e.g. cannot invent an unknown maths theorem)

### Leetcode/Quant interview: any project?
