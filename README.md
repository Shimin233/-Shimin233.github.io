## Questions
### Jekyll installation problem
Try `jekyll new myblog` and`jekyll -v`, in both cases it outputs `no command found`, so installation is not successful. Retry:\
- Jekyll installation not successful: when installing jekyll [from local](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/#local-install), get the Warning:\
`"You don't have [PATH ]in your PATH, gem executables will not run." while using "gem install --user-install bundler"`. 
  - I tried to follow [such solution](https://www.jianshu.com/p/5902b55dc654?utm_campaign=maleskine&utm_content=note&utm_medium=seo_notes&utm_source=recommendation), and refer to [Related Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53979362/you-dont-have-path-in-your-path-gem-executables-will-not-run-while-using), not successful.
  - Another idea from [this article](https://www.jianshu.com/p/82652c7a1fa4), maybe restarting Terminal will have jekyll existing there?
- (optional)when [installing rbenv](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/#rbenv), at the step of 
```
# Set up rbenv integration with your shell
rbenv init

# Check your installation
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
```
have a problem `Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: not found`. [Related Q&A](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/issues/1217)

### CFA I

### Coursera 
[Python and web scrapping](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-science/home/week/1)
 there is a 6-month extension to the IBM cloud trial account, while the IBM cloud account is necessary to create the final result of the final project of week 1; decide carefully when to start the trial + this extension. \

### Data analysis
mindmaps, summaries

### Insights and ideas into certain topics
the difference between subjects with experiments and surveys in real word, and those only need pen&paper(pure maths except part of stats; theoretic physics?): collect facts from real world and trace back to study the underlying mechanism (e.g. empirical stats in finance like empirical duration), while the latter ones build mechanism and structure of theory to lead to results in real word (e.g. cannot invent an unknown maths theorem)

### Leetcode/Quant interview: any project?
